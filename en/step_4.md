Let's create a function to play this music in Sonic Pi.

+ Open up Sonic Pi and choose an empty buffer to write your code in.

+ Define a function called `:intro` — it will not contain any code for the moment.

[[[generic-sonicpi-function]]]

+ Inside the function, create two **lists**. One should be called `notes` and one should be called `durations`. You will use these lists to store the notes for the introduction.

```ruby
notes = []
durations = []
```

Here is the melody you will need, and don't worry if you can't read music, as we have labelled each note. C4 means the note C in octave 4, which is how Sonic Pi refers to notes.
If you can read music, then you might be wondering where the time signature is.  We've left it out to keep things simple.

+ Look at the music notes above. Add each of the note names to the `notes` list, separated by a comma. The first two notes are C4, and in Sonic Pi we would write this as `:c4`.

```ruby
notes = [:c4, :c4]
```

You might have noticed that one of the notes is called B♭4 (B flat). You can write this note in Sonic Pi as `:bb4`.

+ Next, add the durations of each note to the `durations` list.

Notes which are not joined are called **crotchets** and will last for one beat (`1`).

Notes with a tail or joined together with a beam are called **quavers** and will last for half a beat (`0.5`).

It does not matter which way up the notes are.

So the first two durations would be:

```ruby
durations = [0.5, 0.5]
```

Here is the first part of the code - can you continue from here?

```ruby
define :intro do
    notes = [:c4, :c4, :c4, :f4, :f4, :f4]
    durations = [0.5, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 1]
end
```

Here is the full code you will need:

```ruby
define :intro do
    notes = [:c4, :c4, :c4, :f4, :f4, :f4, :e4, :f4, :g4, :a4, :bb4, :g4, :a4]
    durations = [0.5, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1]
end
```

+ Add an instruction on the last line inside your function to play the pattern of notes you have created.

```ruby
play_pattern_timed notes, durations
```

+ Run your program. Nothing will happen! To hear your melody, you will need to **call** the function by typing `intro` right at the bottom of your program, leaving out the `:`.
