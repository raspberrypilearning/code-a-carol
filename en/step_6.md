## Code the partridge

Now that you know how to create a function to play a piece of music, have a go at coding the melody for the line _"a partridge in a pear tree"_.

</div>

+ Put your code inside a function called `:partridge`.

Start by creating a function called `:partridge`.

```ruby
define :partridge do

end
```
--- /hint ---
--- hint ---
Add your `notes` and `durations` to the lists:

```ruby
notes = []
durations = []
```

Then play the melody:

```ruby
play_pattern_timed notes, durations
```
--- /hint ---
--- hint ---
Here is the code you will need:

```ruby
define :partridge do
  notes = [:bb4, :c5, :d5, :bb4, :a4, :f4, :g4, :f4]
  durations = [0.5, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1, 1]
  play_pattern_timed notes, durations
end
```

+ **Call** your partridge function at the bottom of your program, so that you have the following:

```ruby
intro
partridge
```

+ Run the code, and you should hear the melody for the first full verse of the song:

_"On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
A partridge in a pear tree."_

+ You may have noticed that the `partridge` melody starts a little too early. To fix this, you can pause briefly with `sleep` between calling the two functions:

```ruby
intro
sleep 0.5
partridge
```
